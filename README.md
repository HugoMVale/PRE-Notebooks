This GitHub repository contains Jupyter notebooks that illustrate various aspects of polymerization reactions,
along with the mathematical and computational methods used to model and analyze them.
These resources are suitable for both self-learning and classroom instruction.

You can learn to do cool things like the example below! ðŸš€

## Getting Started

To run the tutorials, you can use one of three methods:

* **[Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)** â€” You can open the notebooks directly from the source code repository by selecting _File -> Open notebook -> GitHub -> URL"_, and entering the following repository name: `HugoMVale/PRE-Notebooks`. This method requires a Google account but is likely the easiest for beginners.

* **[Binder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/HugoMVale/PRE-Notebooks/HEAD?labpath=notebooks)** â€” Binder also allows you to open the notebooks directly from the repository. However, you will need to _wait_ for the container to be built. While suitable for beginners, this method requires a bit more patience, and the build process can occasionally fail, requiring a relaunch.

* **Local environment** â€” Alternatively, you can clone or download this repository to your local machine. This method requires a local Python (>=3.10) installation as well as the packages listed
in [`requirements.txt`](requirements.txt). Assuming you're running Windows and have `git` installed, follow these steps:

  ```sh
  git clone https://github.com/HugoMVale/PRE-Notebooks.git
  cd PRE-Notebooks
  python -m venv .venv
  .\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
